# 2 - Agile

# Key

- Agile methods manage project risk through 
  - frequent reviews
  - small adjustments to objectives 
  - small adjustments to processes

# Motivation

- software project requirements often fail because requirements and scope change quickly
- waterfall is not appropriate 
  - "garden vs bridge" analysis
- agile is a process which fits around the state of the project

# Principles

- small teams (2-13)
- frequent
  - short, structured meetings
  - small deliveries of features for review
  - customer engagement
- constant maintenance of design and code quality
  - testing
  - analysis
  - review
  - refactoring
- automation whenever possible
- frequent review and change of objectives and priorities
- frequent review and adjustments of the process

# Risks

- lack of customer engagement
- stakeholder conflict
- complex contracts
- loss of organisational memory
- poor code quality
- poor team coordination and cohesion

# Scrum

- method which focuses on the team, project and process management

## Roles

KEY
- scrum master
  - act as a coach and mentor in order to improve their process
- PO
  - liase between team and other stakeholders
OTHERS (team dependent), e.g
- QA
- Architect
...

## Process

- work are organised into releases, set at the release planning meeting
  - consisting of 2+ sprints
- sprints
  - between 1-3 weeks
  - start with a planning meeting
  - end with a retrospective
- stand-ups/scrums take place throughout  

## Project Launch meeting

- major features are identified
- agree on a MVP
- develop an initial set of user stories
- refine user stories into tasks and pouplate the backlog
- triage tasks : cost estimates, priorities

## Release Planning Meetings

- for larger projects involving multiple releases
- identify deliverables per release
- create a roadmap of milestones aligned with customer priorities
- map backlog tasks to roadmap, but assume that these will be changed in the sprint planning meetings

## Sprint Planning Meeting

- Decide on main goal for the sprint
- Select tasks from the backlog
- Flesh out the selected tasks and make sure that they include 
  - cost estimates
  - priorities
  - assignees
- Ensure that task cost estimates are within the project velocity, i.e. that they reasonably fit the time available
  - effort throughout the sprint is not linear

## Stand-ups

- monitor progress
- usually daily, very short meetings
  - work done since last meeting
  - current work
  - blockers

## Sprint Review Meeting

- Deliver and demo the new version of the software
- Summarise progress, including shortcomings
- Explain deviations from the plan
- Identify new features to be added

# Managing Delays

- better to drop features then delay the delivery 
  - hence the need for MVP, feedback, and prioritisation

- adding more resources is not a panacea
