# 5 - Experiment Design


## Motivation

Experiments play an important role in the scientific process because they provide the empirical data required to test one's hypothesis. As researchers it is important that we understand the experiment design so that we can critique the designs present in the literature and so that we can design our own experiments

## Experiment Design - Essentials

### Hypotheses Revisited

A good hypothesis helps one design an experiment to evaluate it, the essential features of a well-written hypothesis help with the design of the experiment

 - Being **specific** helps identify the information needed
 - Being **falsifiable** helps identify information that would prove the hypothesis wrong
 - Being **parsimonious** helps avoid unnecessarily complex experiments

### Testing Predictions 

The data collected in an experiment serves as a a base for comparisons and evidence for conclusions. In order to interpret those data it is important to be aware of what exactly we are studying and what factors might influence our results.

 - **Independent Variables** (or *grouping variables*) are those which controlled by the experimenter, and they have multiple levels, from a minimum of two usually up to 5 
	- a *condition* is a combination of IV levels

 - **Dependent Variables** are variables which depend on the IV, the things we are measuring

e.g.

 - H : Algorithm X is faster than Quicksort
 - IV : algorithm
	- level 1 : algorithm X
	- level 2 : Quicksort
 - DV : Execution Time

### Fair Comparison

 - isolate our factors of interest
 - minimise *confounding factors* : factors which might affect the DV that we are not interested in


By thinking about and identifying potential confounding factors we can *control for them* and make sure that these **control variables** are the same between experiments 

e.g Control Variables

 - implementation in different programming languages
 - different machines
 - different inputs

There are some things which we cannot control but which can still have an effect on the experiments, these are called **random variables**

### Generalisation

Because we cannot test all possible inputs it is necessary that experiments support generalisation, which means:

 - taking measures from a *representative sample*
 - covering as many cases as possible

 e.g choosing a variable sample of inputs there might be times where our input performs worst, but the hypotheses can still be accepted if we show that our algorithm performs *generally faster* , i.e that it performs better on a *statistically significant* number of cases



## Common Experiment Designs



# Task 1

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8816092

- Independent variable(s) and conditions
  - feedback (light, haptics, both)

- Dependent variable(s)
  - task completion time
  - error distance
  - hand position
  - preference

- Control variable(s)
  - randomised target position : cannot predict target
  - constrained target range : haptics remains perceptible
  - end task with other hand : avoids affecting hand position, better capture of final position
  - hands on desk before each task : all tasks start in same state, better capture final
  - latin square balanced design : limits order effects

- Random variable(s)


- Experiment task
  - locate a target point as quickly and accurate as possible


- Confounding factors

- Within-Subject, fairer because all subjects experience all conditions
