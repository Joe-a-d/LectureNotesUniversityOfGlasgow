    These lecture notes were collated by me from a mixture of sources , the
    two main sources being the lecture notes provided by the lecturer and
    the content presented in-lecture. All other referenced material (if
    used) can be found in the and sections.

    The primary goal of these notes is to function as a succinct but
    comprehensive revision aid, hence if you came by them via a search
    engine , please note that they're not intended to be a reflection of the
    quality of the materials referenced or the content lectured.

    Lastly, with regards to formatting, the pdf doc was typeset in LaTeX,
    using a modified version of Stefano Maggiolo's

Introduction
============

The main goal of this course is to introduce students to :

-   research techniques by actively engaging with the materials;

-   core scientific principles and methods so that one is confident that
    one's findings are valid

-   experimental design and statistical analysis;

-   planning and management techniques;

-   methods on how to structure theses and papers

### Critical Review

Research papers are the main method for communicating methods and
findings and by critically reviewing a paper you review both the and of
the research. This, in turn, will help inform the direction of your own
research

### Literature Search

In this module you'll learn how to search for papers, with the emphasis
being on performing literature surveys so that you can be confident that
you have a broad understanding of a research are

### Literature Survey

After the search you'll want to try and synthesize all the papers you
deemed relevant, this will not only serve as reference material which
you can revisit but it will also help others by providing context to
your own work

### Experiment Design

The goal of this module is to educate you on how to conduct good
experiments, so that you can gather valid data

### Project Proposal

Given that research requires resources it is important that you argue
for why other people should invest in your project

### Analysis of Experiment Designs

In order to be able to critically evaluate a published experiment it is
important that you're able to break it down and fully understand it,
even (in some instances) to be able to replicate it

### Controls & Sample Size

Key concepts which prevents you from adding bias to your conclusions and
allows for them to be generalisable

### Ethics

Research Activities and Outcome
-------------------------------

Research consists of a lot of different activities, but independently of
the field or scale of your project the following always take place:

$$\begin{array}{llll}\text { \textbf{Activity} } & \text {\textbf{Notes}} & \text
{\textbf{Outcome}} \\ \text { Read
and understand a paper } & \text { Read thoroughly and more than once } & \text { Understanding of
the work } \\ \text { Summarise a paper } & \text { Demonstrate that you understand it; } & \text {
Annotated bibliography, notes } \\ & \text { its key points and conclusions } & \\ \text { Explain
how different papers } & \text { Agreements, contradictions, } & \text { Literature review } \\
\text { relate to each other } & \text { extensions, replications } & \\ \text { Identify a gap in
the literature } & \text { Is it useful, relevant, important? } & \text { Research idea } \\ \text {
Identify a research question } & \text { Must be a clear and answerable } & \text { Research
question(s) } \\ \text { arising from that gap } & \text { question } \\ \text { Develop a research
plan to } & \text { Demonstrate feasibility-can you do it } & \text { Research proposal } \\ \text {
address the research question } & \text { and do you have the right resources? } & \\ \text {
Execute the research plan } & \text { Multi-faceted. Collaborate with } & \text { Data, frameworks,
models, } \\ & \text { others, supervise, learn more. } & \text { systems, algorithms, etc. } \\
\text { Write and publish papers } & \text { Journals, conference proceedings, etc. } & \text {
Papers and presentations } \\ \text { Critically review papers } & \text { Peer review, discussing
papers, etc. } & \text { Critique, suggestions, decision }\end{array}$$
