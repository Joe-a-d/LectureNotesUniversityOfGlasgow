\section{Introduction to SE}

    ILOs : motivate the need for the discipline through a series of case studies of project
failures; definitions ; why agile

    \subsection{Why do projects fail? - The Birth of SE}

    \par{There are many specific reasons as to why a project fails, on the client side these are
        usually to do with insufficient political support or ever changing requirements, on the more
        technical side of things it could be something as simple as lack of management or
        developers' skills. Though these reasons vary between projects, the failure
    of any software project is always due to one or more of the following main reasons:}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item a system is built for the wrong reason  
            \item the wrong system is built
            \item the system is built in the wrong way
        \end{itemize}

    \par{Brooks in his seminal work THE MYTHICAL MAN MOTH !! CITE argues that software has some 
    intrinsic properties which make it different to get right:}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item complex : interactions between code are hard to keep track
        \item intangible : different to reason about something which is so abstract
        \item malleable : hard to keep track of changes
        \item scale : large codebases
        \item evolutionary : constantly evolving to meet new needs
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{SE as Construction}

    \par{As a consequence in the 1960s there was a desire to bring methodologies from other
    disciplines in order to be able to tackle these issues in a methodological fashion. A common
approach was to use a \ita{waterfall} approach towards software development. It is now known that
his approach does not work, because software is now so complex that no single developer can keep
track of it all.}
