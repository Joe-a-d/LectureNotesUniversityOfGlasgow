The following notes were typeset using a modified version of @stefano-maggiolo custom class.

The modified version I'm using can be found in this repo [here](https://github.com/Joe-a-d/Algebra_1R_1S_UniversityGlasgow/notes.cls). It has some neat additions like:

The original can be found at Stefano Maggiolo's personal blog [here](http://blog.poormansmath.net/files/notes.cls). I would also highly recommend chekcing his posts on $\LaTeX$ "best-practices".

**N.B:** Besides the mods to Stefano's class, I've also included some shortcuts to common mathematical symbols (e.g. set notation) see the preamble of the notes to see them.

These will be updated (hopefully) daily after every lecture, if you're a fellow student at the University of Glasgow, or just mathematically inclined and would like to use these notes feel free to do so. The best way would be to fork this repository, this way you can always be up to date, and also if you find any mistakes or improve them in some way you can just submit a pull request.
