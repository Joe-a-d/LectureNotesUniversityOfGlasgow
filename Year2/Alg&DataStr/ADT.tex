%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  DISCLAIMER  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
	\par{These lecture notes were collated by me from a mixture of sources , the two main sources being the lecture notes provided by the lecturer and the
content presented in-lecture. All other referenced material (if used) can be found in the \ita{Bibliography} and \ita{References} sections.}
	\par{The primary goal of these notes is to function as a succinct but comprehensive revision aid, hence if you came by them via a search engine , please note
that they're not intended to be a reflection of the quality of the materials referenced or the content lectured.}
	\par{Lastly, with regards to formatting, the pdf doc was typeset in \LaTeX , using a modified version of Stefano Maggiolo's \href{http://blog.poormansmath.net/
latex-class-for-lecture-notes/}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{class}}}}
