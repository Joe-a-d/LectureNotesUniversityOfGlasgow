# WAD2 - AJAX

Jesse James Garret coined the term in 2005 [add bibtex] but the technologies involved were around since the 90s.

## Main Functionality

 - Remove the *start-stop interaction* model, by allowing a page to be updated without having to wait for a server response.

 There is an intermediate layer in the *client-side* : **AJAX engine**, which allows the user to interact with the DOM. So there's a split between *user activity* and *client-side data processing*

### Tech involved


## Mechanics

### Components

 - XML/JSON/txt : model data which can be accessed via the DOM

 ### Async, HOW?
