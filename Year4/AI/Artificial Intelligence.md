### Outline

- field evolution
	- [[neural networks]] were the first systems considered to be AI
		- neurons as computational units
	- [[expert systems]]
	- deep blue : mixture of NN and expert systems
- common characteristics of intelligent agents
- perspectives on what constitutes AI; 2 pairs of dimensions
	- Thought Vs Action
	- Human-Like vs [[Rational]]
	- giving us 4 possible views when these dimensions are paired
- _thinking humanly_
	- closely related with cognitive science
	- understanding how humans think and try and replicate those processes
- _thinking rationally_
	- logic 
	- [[problems with formalisation of informal knowledge]]
- _acting rationally_ (**this is the perspective used in this course**)
	- we do not necessarily care about the thinking processes which lead to "right" behaviour, only that the behaviour itself is rational
	- e.g. some reflexes are rational, hand away from stove
- Hype
	- argues that there has been a lot of hype, particularly since 10s when DL started to show significant results
- open research questions
	- Explaining/understanding (e.g. learning causal models of the world)
	- Generalization (learning-to-learn, compositionality, etc.) 
	- Intuition and common sense
	- Self-awareness and consciousness.
		- do robots need to be aware of their existence as agents?
	- Energy efficiency
		- compare brain few watts vs models requiring supercomputers 

- [[how we define and evaluate an agent]]
- [[is the agent rational]]
- [[the importance of setting up a performance measure which is not defined and cannot be gammed by the agent]]
- everytime you see a problem , you should aim to frame it in light of its [[task environment]]
